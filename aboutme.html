<p>My name is Denisse Alvarado. I am a 16 year old from Granada Hills who enjoys to play soccer, going to comic cons, and watching Doctor Who. I am a part of a soccer club called Valley United and have been involved with this team for 5 years. I am also a part of the soccer team at my high school- Granada Hills Charter High School- and have been on this team for 2 years. Aside from sports, I love to dress up as my favorite characters from television (especially characters from Doctor Who), and attending conventions. It has been a hobby of mine since I was 5 years old and will continue to be so for a long time. I value family, friendship, and learning the most. </p>
