<b> <h1> Biography </h1> </b>


<p>My name is Denisse Alvarado. I am a 16 year old from Granada Hills who enjoys to play soccer, going to comic cons, and watching Doctor Who. I am a part of a soccer club called Valley United and have been involved with this team for 5 years. I am also a part of the soccer team at my high school- Granada Hills Charter High School- and have been on this team for 2 years. Aside from sports, I love to dress up as my favorite characters from television (especially characters from Doctor Who), and attending conventions. It has been a hobby of mine since I was 5 years old and will continue to be so for a long time. I value family, friendship, and learning the most. </p>

<b> <h1> Likes </h1> </b>

<center> <p> I like food, soccer, The Office, and to read. My favorite foods include, but are not limited to: shrimp, chicken, pancakes, waffles, and french toast. My favorite soccer player is Messi and my favorite team is Barcelona. Although a majority of The Office episodes are awesome, my favorite episode is called: Stress Relief. When I am not watching The Office, I like to read. One of my favorite books is The Fault In Our Stars by John Green.  </p> </center>

<b> <h1> Dislikes </h1> </b>

<center> <p> I don't dislike a lot of things, since I am generally a positive person, however, I am not fond of curry, cats, and liars. </p> </center>

<center> <p> There are several differences and similarities between Python and Scratch. For example differences may be: scratch has blocks pre-made for you, while in Python, you have to hand code everything. Also, Python is much less glitchy. Similarities may be: conditionals. Debugging my program was interesting. At first, it was a bit frustrating since it was completely new, however, as time progressed and I received help as well as became a bit more familiar with the program, it was less frustrating. </p> </center>
